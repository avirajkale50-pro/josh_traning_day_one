Given the table:
orders

id |  user_id  | status | created_at

Suggest appropriate indexes.
Explain why you chose them?
Answer: 
There can be multiple index we can create according two need of our application and the query we are using but the query are not mention here so I am assuming common scenarios and suggest the index based on that, the index we can create are like :
1. Primary Key(id) on this I will create primary key index which is a b tree index
Reasons : 
	a. `id` uniquely identifies an order
	b. Make query faster which include `WHERE id = ?`
	c. Required for efficient joins.
	
2. Index on `user_id` on this also we have to create b tree index 
We can create it like : 
 	CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders (user_id);
Reasons : 
	a. any system frequently search for the user so to make it faster.
	b. user need to review there orders so in that query as well we have to find the order data with user id.

3. (status, created_at) on this we can create composite index
Reasons:
	a. As the user often check when they order something and the current status of the order at same time
	b. It works good for pagination or recent-orders views
	c. It will only check for that row so the user experience will much more smoother while user review there order
